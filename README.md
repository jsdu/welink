weLink is an iOS app made in xCode with coacoa pods. 
Made during Hack the North 2015 and used indico API, facebook login API, and firebase for backend.

weLink generates a customized list of 'suitable' individuals for each user through a mixture of their
proximity and interests. Location services may be toggled on and off depending on whether or not the
individual is looking for someone with similar interests. There is also a chat system
integrated with the app, allowing individuals to communicate and share ideas with one another. After 
people meet up an chat, they can send pictures of themselves or the activities they did through social
media (or post it on their weLink profile). These activities will also give the user points, which are
used to rank them on a leaderboard based on how active and satisfied they were with their meetings.
